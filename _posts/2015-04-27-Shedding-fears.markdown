I've lived with all kind of fears all my live. I've shed them under the rug all the time, up to the time when I didn't even recognize them any more as fears but as mere virtual necessities and anxieties. I've been under therapy to help me out, and I learned some very useful tools from there which have helped me a lot, but have not been enough to break free.

And that's how I see it now, I've been a slave of all those fears -- and still I am. These fears have led me to rough situations, and even to mold my being into something I don't like nor feel identified with. I've broken many relationships just from the fear of losing those people, of not being transcendent on them, on not being relevant, not being enough. I think we've all been there, with more or less intensity, but that has been the center of my life for so long, always clinging to someone to feel I'm worth something; just to realize, some time after, that it would increase those fears even further.

Two days ago, she who was my girlfriend and the closest person I've ever had in my life, decided that her sexual liberty was more valuable than whatever we had. I don't blame her, I don't want to do it, freedom has a very high price and I'm even proud that she chose to pay for it. Additionally I had been depressed for a month, after she had sex with another person, and I had been unable to get through all of my fears and was rendered mostly a walking zombie, grudging through the day to day. I fought to get better -- to be happy -- for some days during that depression, but I gave up after the second week as I was utterly exhausted and felt like I had no help; which was probably my fault as I'm pretty difficult to deal on those situations. And the last thing would be that I've been questioning my gender, which was just one more thing to add to the whole mess.

But when she told me she had been with another person again and my heart felt shattered to a thousand pieces, I decided I was no longer going to deal with this; gave her the two options, compromise or her freedom. After crying for a while and some help from my family it came into my head: My fears were going to keep coming back, year after year, destroying everything I loved for no reason whatsoever.

And so, this is it. This is the time I stand against all that I fear and is not real. This is the time I learn to be myself, no matter what social exclusion, mockery, ridicule it leads me to. This is the time I'll learn to feel proud of who I am, of how I am, and I'll no longer fear to cry in front of people. Fear binds our hands with our imagination and brings nothing good and I'm done with it. It's going to be a very long way, but I'm starting it now, with strong determination and people that will help we whenever they can. I will no longer allow unreal things to break all that is dear to me.

I had to get this out of my chest. It's not the same writing here that in a notebook and I hope it might be useful for some of you. My dearest thanks.
